## BMMB 852 HW #11

### Jessica Eckard

This assignment requires writing a Makefile and a markdown report.

You can reuse the Makefile developed for your previous assignment, which generated a VCF file.

Evaluate the effects of the variants in your VCF file.

Try using a software tool like VEP or snpEff.  Add the effect prediction steps to your Makefile and make them part of the workflow.

If, for some reason, you can't make any of the variant effect prediction software work, you may use visual inspection via IGV to describe the effect of variants.

Find variants with different effects.
Write a markdown report that summarizes the process and your results.

------

I was unable to get either VEP or snpEff prediction software to work properly and ended up visualizing the VCF file in IGV.

Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located on chromosome NC_000913.3, at positions 80,091bp and 110,823bp were identified and inspected. These were the only variants that were picked up on IGV.

## Variants Analyzed

**Variant 1:** Position 80,091bp

**Chromosome:** NC_000913.3

**Position:** 80,091

**Reference Allele:** G

**Alternate Allele:** A

**Type:** SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism)

**Quality Score:** 3.831

**Allele Count:** 1

**Total Alleles:** 2

**Is Filtered Out:** No

**Depth:** 9

### Visual Inspection in IGV:

I inspected the region of chromosome NC_000913.3 at position 80,091 in IGV using the BAM file and the VCF file annotated by snpEff.

The variant appears as a substitution of a G to A.

The depth at this position is 9, indicating that the variant is supported by several reads.

The annotation in the VCF (ANN: A||MODIFIER) suggests that this variant is classified as a modifier variant, and so it likely has a low impact on gene function.

Mapping quality is high (60), indicating that the reads are well-aligned.

No filtering has been applied to this variant.

Based on visual inspection, this variant is likely to be of low functional impact as it is classified as a modifier and does not seem to disrupt coding or regulatory regions significantly.

### Visual Inspection in IGV:

I inspected the region of chromosome NC_000913.3 at position 110,823 in IGV using the BAM file and the VCF file annotated by snpEff.

The reference base at this position is G, and the alternate allele is A.

The depth at this position is 10, indicating that this variant is supported by reads as well.

The annotation (ANN: A||MODIFIER) suggests that this variant is also classified as a modifier.

Mapping quality is again high (60), showing good alignment of the reads.

Like Variant 1, this variant is also classified as a modifier variant, indicating a low functional impact. Based on the visual inspection, there are no apparent disruptions to coding regions or critical functional elements.

### Overall Conclusion

Both variants, located at positions 80,091 and 110,823 on chromosome NC_000913.3, are SNPs that have been classified as modifier variants. Based on their annotations, these variants are likely to have minimal impact on gene function. Visual inspection using IGV showed that the variants are supported by sequencing reads and that they do not appear to disrupt any essential coding regions or regulatory elements significantly. Both variants have high mapping quality, suggesting that they are reliably detected.
While these variants are interesting to report, based on the current annotations and visual inspection, they do not appear to be of high functional importance (e.g., they are not frameshifts, nonsense mutations, or splice site variants).
