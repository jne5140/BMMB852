# BMMB852 HW#12

### Jessica Eckard

This assignment requires the presence of a Makefile, a README.md markdown file, and a design.csv file. 

Please add all three files to your repository and submit the link to your repository. 

You may reuse the Makefile created in previous assignments. 

Create a Makefile that can produce a VCF file by downloading a reference genome, indexing it, and then downloading fastq files from SRA, aligning them to the reference and calling variants. 

Create a README.md file that explains how to run the Makefile 

Collect a set of samples from the SRA database that match your genome. 

Create a design.csv file that lists the samples to be processed. 

Using GNU parallel or any other method of your choice run the Makefile on all (or a a subset) of the samples.

Merge the resulting VCF files into a single one. 

Discuss what you see in your VCF file. 

----------------- 

The Makefile, README.md file, and design.csv file are all located in the HW12 folder.  

I tried for days and days to successfully automate my Makefile, I could not fully debug my file. I included one of my numerous attempts in the repository. Additionally, my computer is on the fritz and crashed many times trying to do this, so I am not sure if this is an issue with my computer or if I really just cannot make my Makefile work. Specifically, it refused to recognize my design.csv file.

To complete the rest of the assignment, I manually adjusted my Makefile to obtain the vcf files from the URLs listed in the design.csv file.

I compressed the vcf files

	bgzip variants1.vcf 
	bgzip variants2.vcf 
	bgzip variants3.vcf 
	bgzip variants4.vcf 
	bgzip variants5.vcf 

and then indexed them using tabix

	tabix -p vcf variants1.vcf.gz 
	tabix -p vcf variants2.vcf.gz
	tabix -p vcf variants3.vcf.gz 
	tabix -p vcf variants4.vcf.gz 
	tabix -p vcf variants5.vcf.gz 

and merged them together.

	bcftools merge -o merged.vcf -O v --force-samples variants1.vcf.gz variants2.vcf.gz variants3.vcf.gz variants4.vcf.gz variants5.vcf.gz 

I analyzed the merged VCF file in both IGV and also using bcftools.

	bcftools stats merged.vcf > vcf_stats.txt 

### Results: 

### Analysis:

Analysis of the VCF File 

- 5 samples are included in the merged VCF file. 

- Number of Records: 20 total variant records. 

- SNPs: 17 records are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), making up the majority. 

- Indels: 3 records are insertions or deletions (indels). 

- No Multiallelic Sites: All records have a single alternate allele. 

- No Other Variants: There are no multi-nucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs) or symbolic variants. 

- Ti/Tv Ratio: 3.25, which is relatively high and indicates good-quality variant calls. For most high-quality datasets, Ti/Tv should be around 2.0 to 3.0. 

- Singleton SNPs: There are 10 singleton SNPs (allele count = 1), and all are transitions. No singletons are transversions or indels. 

- AF = 0.0: 10 SNPs (all transitions) have a frequency of 0.0, meaning these are unique variants in the dataset. 

- AF = 0.99: 7 SNPs (4 transversions, 3 transitions) and 3 indels are present at near-fixed frequencies across the samples. 

- The quality of variants varies, with scores ranging from 3.7 to 228.3: 

	- Lower quality variants (e.g., QUAL = 3.7 or 3.8) might require further review or filtering. 

	- High-quality variants (e.g., QUAL > 100) are more reliable. 

- Most Common Substitution: C>T transitions dominate (8 occurrences), followed by G>A transitions (4 occurrences). 

- Transversions: Relatively rare, with only A>C, C>A, G>T, and T>C substitutions observed. 

- The depth of coverage varies: 
	- Low Depth (9–12): Accounts for a significant portion (40%) of sites. 

	- High Depth (16–23): Covers the remaining 60% of sites. 

- These distributions suggest variability in sequencing coverage, which could impact variant confidence. 

 

### Conclusions 

**Variant Types:** The dataset has mostly SNPs (85%) and a small proportion of indels (15%). 

**Ti/Tv Ratio:** The high Ti/Tv ratio indicates strong variant quality. 

**Coverage:** Depth of coverage is uneven, with some low-coverage sites that may need further evaluation. 

**Quality:** Most variants are of good quality, but a few low-quality variants should be inspected and maybe filtered out.
